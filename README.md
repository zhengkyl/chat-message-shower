# Chat Message Shower

It's show-er, like "to show", but you should shower too.

## Flow

- user authenticates with twitch

- creates session

  - multiple sessions (devices), but only one endpoint per user

  - show browser source url with recreate?

  - show all connected to browser source url?

  - show all sessions in ui with revoke?

- extension sends message to common ingest endpoint

- updates their websocket endpoint
